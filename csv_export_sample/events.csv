Latin America offers huge opportunities in payments innovation. Despite recession in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela and meager GDP growth in Mexico, Colombia and Chile, e-commerce and emerging payments are growing rapidly, from 15%-40% per year depending on the market. With rapid growth for a least five more years, a large unbanked population and expanding penetration of smartphones, the digital transformation has arrived in Latin America’s payments industry.

Yet considerable challenges remain for payment players and merchants in Latin America. The use of cash payment methods, local credit card networks, complicated installment plans, and an opaque yet complex regulatory environment make billing customers a challenge at best and a complete quagmire at worst. Growing competition in the e-commerce enablement space means payment processors must constantly improve their offerings to remain relevant. Companies without a local strategy will perform poorly. As growth returns to the region in 2017, payment players and merchants must be ready to embrace rapid changes.

In our panel, Latin America: Local payments for an international community, we will cover why Latin America is challenging from a payments perspective and identify particular opportunities for innovation.

At this year’s UCD Conference, we’ll be exploring the philosophical tension between humanity and science in post-digital, networked civilizations; what does it mean to be human in our new global digital community, and how do we design for our evolving species?

We’ll be hearing from the people who are bringing tomorrow to life – and bringing life to tomorrow – though the Internet of things, ambient intelligence, big data, sympathetic machines, hyper personalisation, social science, robotics, new applications for simulated worlds, virtual reality, service design, artificial intelligence, gaming, cryptocurrency, human behaviour analysis, computer vision, security, automation, simulated worlds, digital content and engagement, machine learning, biohacking, and the future of defense, flight, energy, social good, civil disobedience, cities, media, cars, commerce, health, finance, the global poor…

Come and meet scientists, technologists, and philosophers; and also designers, disruptors, and activists. Talk to people who are inventing new ways for technology to fill the gaps in our world; people who create digital solutions (and – yes – robots) to provide services that the infrastructure of our society is unable to provide.

Beyond the debate about the rise of the machines vs. the fall of humanity, be prepared to confront your own digital behavior – there’s no reward without risk at UCD! – and to come away with a new sense of awe and insight into the high-stakes game of designing technology for humanity.

We even sponsored the first Bitcoin Summit organized by the Bitcoin Foundation in May 2013 at the Convention Center in San Jose. It was a very interesting experience at the time with the Winklevoss Twins on stage, with panels of investors and a strong lineup of entrepreneurs working hard to create a new world and eliminate friction in P2P transactions, micro-payments and international payments.

 

After several waves that saw the rise of the Bitcoin up to $1,200, the fear of many financial institutions and regulatory bodies around the world, many investments long forgotten and gone, the fall of the Bitcoin down to $170 and its rise again around $600 today, we want to revisit this topic and better understand where we are.

 

Far from being dead, the Bitcoin is still there and is the most traded crypto-currency in volume even if other currencies were created by companies like Ethereum, Ripple, etc. The Blockchain seems to take over with many applications (it will be the subject of another event later) as our last event “Can the Blockchain survive without Bitcoin” on Feb 18, 2016 illustrated (Video available for purchase or free to Online members at https://www.baypayforum.com/021816).

 

In this session, we will retrace how we got where we are, what the status is, in crypto-currencies and where we are going with executives in the industry who will share their experience and opinions.
