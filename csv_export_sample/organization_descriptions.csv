A powerful network for entrepreneurs, investors, executives and organizations who believe in building the best ventures with global impact. Acceleration and growth are part of our DNA. 

Funding—
The fund typically invests an initial amount of up to US$ 25,000 in a company's seed round, and may invest up to US$ 1 million in follow-on investments. 

Hands-on Advice & Mentorship—
Our Founding Partners have a solid track record in helping, creating, growing and selling companies. They have a hands-on approach when working with the startups and are actively involved throughout our acceleration program. During this program entrepreneurs are paired with mentors that provide support and networking that transcends the acceleration period.  

Community—
NXTP Labs has had a strong role in developing the venture capital ecosystem in Latin America. Our alumni to date (Jan '15) sum more than 360 founders focused on innovation spread throughout the region and the globe. Our acceleration program puts a strong focus on cross-fertilization between entrepreneurs and other companies. 

Investment Focus—
AdTech, AgTech, B2B, BigData, Bitcoin, CloudTech, eCommerce, Education, FinTech, Mobile, Gaming, Internet of Things, Payment, Security, Services, Social, Travel, Video.
 
Selected companies will be offered co-working space in our headquarters located in Palermo Soho, Buenos Aires.  The location is ideal — providing many networking and casual mentoring opportunities. Entrepreneurs will be offered perks and networking contacts spread around the region to help companies in their expansion. 

At the end of the program founders will pitch their company to an audience of qualified investors for additional funding during our Demo Day.

NXTP Labs provides entrepreneurs with a structured business growth roadmap based on 3 key value-adding elements: 1. The knowledge that is acquired and transferred to entrepreneurs from kick-off day; 2. The synergy that is created in the workplace and the partner networking; 3. A network of industry and investor contacts.

NXTP Labs is not about how to write a business plan. It's not an exercise on how smart you are, or how well you use the research tools. The end result is not a PowerPoint slide deck for a VC presentation.  

NXTP Labs helps high impact founding teams turn an idea into a great company."
